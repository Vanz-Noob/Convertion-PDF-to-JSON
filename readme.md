# PDF Invoice Product and Summary Extractor

A Python-based web application built with Streamlit that extracts product details and summary values (Total, VAT, Amount Due) from PDF invoices. The extracted data is presented in a structured JSON format and can be downloaded.

## Features

*   **Upload PDF:** Upload a PDF invoice file through a user-friendly Streamlit interface.
*   **Table Extraction:** Extracts tables from the PDF using `pdfplumber`.
*   **Header Recognition:** Identifies the main product table based on "Description" and "Amount (USD)" headers.
*   **Multi-Page Tables:** Continues reading data rows from subsequent pages if the header is found on the first page.
*   **Data Processing:** Converts "Amount (USD)" values to floats and treats "Description" values as product names.
*   **Summary Extraction:** Attempts to extract Total, VAT, and Amount Due values from the PDF text.
*   **JSON Output:** Generates a structured JSON file containing the extracted products and summary values.
*   **Download Results:** Download the generated JSON file.
*   **Preview Data:** View the extracted products and summary information on the web interface.
*   **Copyright Footer:** Displays "Â© 2025 Renaldi Azhar. All rights reserved." on all pages.
